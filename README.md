#This code is a bash script that will prompt the user to type a positive integer and will print all the numbers from 1 up to 
#and include the number entered by the user and whether or not the number is odd or even.
#The user will be required to enter a positive number (any number higher than 0) and will be displayed the sequence of 
#numbers that lead up to the number entered by the user.
#For example, if the user enters in 5, the program will return:
#1 Odd
#2 Even
#3 Odd
#4 Even
#5 Odd
